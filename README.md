# Mozilla-Health-2017
Zombie Apocalypse Proof Mesh - Scan and establish live mesh networks for even better first responder services nationwide - A Team project for the Mozilla Health 2017 hackathon challenge.


Here on this Github page we will demonstrate strategies and goal towards the following Items;

A. Identifying populated areas with poor internet connectivity.
B. Identifying populated areas with cost prohibitive internet connection costs
C. Determining the amount of internet enabled devices in an area.
D. Determining (through curated databases and various analysis algorithms) what current available, applicable technologies and emerging applicable technologies can resolve connectivity issues for a given area.
E. Determining financial feasibility and sustainability of upfront internet infrastructure and maintenance costs.
F. Determine friendly, ethical, non-intrusive and productive ways, to use the tools we create, to help communications providers, municipalities, and the public understand where and why there are coverage gaps.
G. Determine ways in which accountability for fair allocation of infrastructure and bandwidth can be encouraged(such as tracking bandwidth allocation or throttle and praising companies that are treating all customers fair in this regard) through our project, and or internet mainstays like browsers and internet access login portals.
H. Research and promote protocols and applications and tips (such as mobile data compression applications) that help individuals save money on internet access.

What we have:
Live demo and basic proof of concept for Item C.

    1.    Twitter and NOAA API: source of the data
    2.    IBM Watson Sentiment Analysis BLOCK: this API allows you to analyse and gauge emotion, and determine where a text input sits on a negative-postive scale
    3.    PubNub: streams the data from Twitter, NOAA, processes the data with IBM Watson, and publishes the data to the Initial State dashboard
    4.    Initial State: visualizes the data in a beautiful, live-updating dashboard
    5.    Google Maps Geocoding API
    6.    Javasript
    7.    Python
    8.    Node.JS (Save this project from possible Python crashes!)


What is next:
Make lots of improvements to the code base.

Research current commercial or academic methods of achieving similar to what our project seeks to achieve.

Crowd-source more ideas of possible indicators. Validate test and integrate new indicators.

Research and implement complimentary ways to analyse areas less than a full zip code.

Integrate ways we can analyse portions instead of full zip codes.

Create a team to help with the development of Item H.
